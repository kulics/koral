// Tests for declaration-time type checking of generic functions and types
// These tests verify that type errors are caught at declaration time, not instantiation time

// EXPECT-ERROR: Invalid operation plus between types T and T

// Test 1: Generic function with type error in body
// The error should be caught at declaration time because the body
// tries to use + on a generic type without Addable constraint
